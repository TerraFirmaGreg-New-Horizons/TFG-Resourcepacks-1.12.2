# TFG-Resourcepacks-1.12.2

This is a fork (by brachy84) of a fork of Zederrian Technology for GregTech Community Edition unofficial, with additional textures and models created by [Puzzlebark](https://www.curseforge.com/members/puzzlebark).

The textures and models that were used in built-in mode will be moved here and will be updated in the future in the TerraFirmaGreg: New-Horizons modpack before version 4.2.0 to allow players to choose how they want to see the game


Zederrian Technology was created by [Zerrens](https://forum.industrial-craft.net/core/user/12229-zerrens/), and the original GT5U version of the resource pack can be found [here](https://github.com/MCTian-mi/Zederrian-Technology-GT5U/).
